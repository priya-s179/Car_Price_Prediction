# About Us:

The CarWise project aims to solve the problem of providing valuable insights into the car industry using data analysis techniques. The project is focused on analyzing various aspects of cars such as price range, body type, engine size, and brand to help consumers make informed decisions about cars.

# Problem Statement:

First-time car buyers face various challenges in the car-buying process due to a lack of knowledge about cars, overwhelming options, intimidating negotiation processes, and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges make it harder for buyers to choose the right car that fits their budget and meets their needs while also getting a fair price.

# Challenge:

The main challenge of the project is to develop an intelligent car selection and price prediction system that can analyze large amounts of car data and provide accurate predictions of car prices based on their features.

# Technology Used:

This requires the use of advanced data visualization methods using Python.

# Goal:

The task is to understand the factors affecting the price of cars and to identify the top brands and car categories based on the mean price. The aim is to provide insights into the data that can help stakeholders such as car manufacturers, dealerships, and consumers to make informed decisions.

# How we started:

The CarWise project involves preprocessing a dataset by cleaning and transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis. Then we performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset.

The dataset contains information about cars, including their car name, fuel type, turbocharged, car body, avg mpg, and price. The goal of EDA is to gain insights into the data, identify patterns, and test hypotheses.
